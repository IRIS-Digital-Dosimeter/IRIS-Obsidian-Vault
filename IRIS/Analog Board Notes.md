## Diode
- reverse bias?
- input is "dark current"
	- from thermal excitation on the diode
	- constnat input
	- problem occurs if this baseline is too large bc you lose dynamic range on the op amps 0-3.3V range
## Op-Amp
- scintillation preamplifier?
- not a standard config (noninverting, differentiator, integrator)
- 0-3.3V range
## Capacitor
- capacitance controls sensitivity
	- 
- smaller capacitance = less sensitive
- larger capacitance = more sensitive (includes more of the baseline signal)
## Resistor
- resistance controls baseline
	- resistance proportional to  baseline
		- current * resistance
